The fire pits and s’mores are still the same, but there will be way more adrenaline, happy hours, and entertainment than the camps of your youth. Choose a long weekend in Utah, Northern California, or North Carolina, all of which have both camping and glamping options available. You’ll be able to try out slacklining (similar to tightrope walking), trail running, rock climbing, hiking, and other activities, as well as take classes on packing, night photography, backcountry first aid, and other useful outdoorsy skills.",
